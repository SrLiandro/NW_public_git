In doing so, as «Reichskommissar for Price Supervision», he saw his main task as stimulating the mechanisms of the market economy precisely through state intervention. This principle of «liberal interventionism» overlapped with the politician's conviction that «life is struggle ... and that also prices should be formed in accordance with the natural laws of struggle to ensure a comparatively high standard of living for everyone and generally to create the best conditions for production»."

    GER_responsible_complicity_desc:0 "Gördöller realised that economic education of the people had in itself a socially integrating function and could serve as a means against fragmentation and class struggle. The justified intention of economic education was to 'overcome the circle of mistrust and suspicion on the part of wage earners and encourage them to show tolerance and leniency', which in a broader political context would mean: through education 'to restore recognition in relation to the economic and social order'. In this tactical approach to the 'instrumental' use of economic education one can trace the idea that in the process of learning 'natural laws' the workers should acquire the skills of 'responsible complicity' in the economic life of the enterprise, to teach them to subordinate their individual interest to the need to solve general economic problems and to better understand the significance of the strict economic, financial and sociopolitical programmes implemented by the government. Gördeler also has no doubt that spreading economic knowledge to workers can have a positive impact on their work efficiency."

    NWgermany.1.desc:0 "The former head of the German Communist Party, Ernst Thalmann, has been held in prison in Berlin for several months. He was arrested a couple of days before the last Reichstag elections. Initially it was planned to bring Telman to trial for high treason. For this purpose, the intelligence services began to collect materials that were to prove the preparation of the KPD for the putsch. However, because of the great legal problems in trying to prove this information, and in order to avoid a failure like in the Leipzig trial for setting fire to the Reichstag, during 1935 we decided to abstain from judicial decision.\n\nNovember 1, 1935 the Second Senate of the People's Court revoked the preliminary detention (without stopping the proceedings in a court case as such) and simultaneously handed Telman over to the Gestapo for «protective custody». At this point, the international protest movement against Telman's imprisonment had reached its climax. World figures sympathetic to the Communists are writing letters in support of him and asking that he be released from custody. Perhaps we should go along with them, so as not to irritate other governments."

    NWgermany.2.desc:0 "From the beginning the Nazi Party had two wings: a right wing and a left wing. There was a long struggle between them, culminating in the events of the «Night of the Long Knives», when the main leaders of the Socialist faction of the NSDAP and the SA Stormtroopers command were murdered. However, one important functionary of the party, Otto Strasser, the younger brother of Gregor Strasser, the leader of the Left, managed to survive. While he was in Prague last year, he announced the formation of an «alternative German government» to which many opposition politicians and dissidents began to join, not only from the NSDAP, but also from other parties: the DNVP, KPD, SPD.\n\nOne important issue on which the two factions differed was the attitude to the Reichswehr. The leaders of the Left proposed abolishing the old army and replacing it with a «people's army» de facto legalizing the SA Stormtroopers. This caused great apprehension on the part of the Reichswehr generals, who demanded that Hitler choose between them and his party comrades.\n\nThen he trusted the military and chose in their favor - but now they betrayed Hitler and this in turn damaged the trust in him of the part of the NSDAP that oscillated between the two main factions. Today this split has become clear, as Strasser has moved his government from Prague to the southeast of the country and some NSDAP officials and politicians have sworn him in."

Old Wilhelm, though supported by the old Prussian aristocracy and the higher generals, is extremely unpopular because of his defeat in the Great War. His son, Crown Prince Wilhelm, has similar views to his father, but is not stained by his reputation as a defeatist, even though he collaborated with the Nazis.

But thanks to the actions of our secret services, we have obtained compromising information on the heads of the army - Field Marshal General Werner von Blomberg and Commander-in-Chief of the Land Forces Werner von Fritsch.

However, there were too many haters of the Hohenzollerns and opponents of the restoration in our party who thought they had already fulfilled their role.\n\nNow that we have rid ourselves of the influence of these radicals and find ourselves in a situation with a tarnished reputation ourselves, it is worth recalling these plans and suggesting that one of Wilhelm II's heirs take the throne."

From this point of view, Hitler is nothing more than a test «hammer of God» used to pound on people and things to see whether they still have life, whether they still have faith, will, strength, and the power to renew themselves. Where these good qualities are lacking, the hammer destroys old forms to powder-just as in Scripture a tree that does not bear fruit is to be mercilessly cut down. But when fruiting is still possible, the will and power to renew will inevitably arise after the severe test of these blows; under new forms, but in the old spirit, the spirit of the «Mother» according to Faust, which dwells in the depths of our soul, the soul of every man, the soul of every nation, the soul of the West. Revolutionary in form, conservative in essence, is a policy that follows from such a consideration... Victory over Hitler and his destructive system, victory in this war over the forces of destruction, is no less certain than the advent of Hitler and this war.

Then we will keep under military control the territory that was defined in Moscow as the sphere of German interests. Naturally, however, we will be forced for military reasons to continue fighting against those Polish armed forces that will be at that moment on Polish territory belonging to the sphere of Russian interests. Russian Russian forces, please discuss this with Molotov immediately and find out whether the Soviet Union does not consider it desirable that the Russian armed forces act at the appropriate moment against the Polish armed forces in the area of the sphere of Russian interests and, for their part, occupy this territory. In our opinion, this would not only be a relief for us, but would also correspond to the spirit of the Moscow agreements and Soviet interests...»"

The Wehrmacht became more and more desperate with each advance we made, sometimes fighting until only ruins remained around them.
